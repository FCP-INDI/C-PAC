Reorient BOLD:
    description:
        Reorients the header's grid to the chosen orientation.
        Highly recommended to run this nodeblock first in the BOLD pipeline. This is to ensure all data is set to the same grid orientation.

Scale BOLD:
    description:
        Scales the BOLD to a different size.
        Often used in rodent pipelines where the raw BOLD is much smaller.

Truncate BOLD Timeseries:
    description:
        Truncates the BOLD timeseries to the desired length, by dropping chosen TRs/volumes.
        Often used to drop the first few TRs, but can drop TRs at the end as well.
