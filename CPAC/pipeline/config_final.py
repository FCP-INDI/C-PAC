#A pipeline for each subject that needs preprocessing is spawned on single nodes of the cluster.
# To avoid I/O overhead the pipeline should only use the resources(cores) from that node.
# The users can enable this feature on Sun Grid Engine by modifying their parallel environment
# or adding a new parallel ennviroment using the exisiting environment parameters(some parameters tweaked)

#To create new environment using old environment follow ths  procedure

# 1. find the parallel environments u have on cluster
# $ qconf -spl

# 2. look through your parallel environments. Mine looks like this

#$ qconf -sp mpi

# 3. use old to create new environment
# $ qconf -sp mpi > cpac_mpi 

# 4. change the allocation_rule highlighted with the arrow to $pe_slots,
#    use your favourite text editor to accomplish this
