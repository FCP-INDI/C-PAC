<h2>Introduction &amp; Background<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-background" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Connectome-wide Association Studies (CWAS) allow researchers to explore relationships between patterns of functional connectivity (the functional connectome), behavior, and phenotypic factors.The CWAS method implemented in C-PAC (Shehzad et al., in prep) examines the correlation among patterns of functional connectivity and phenotypes using a combination of Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) and Multivariate Distance Matrix Regression (MDMR; Reiss et al., 2010). Compared to traditional univariate techniques which require rigorous correction for multiple comparisons, a multivariate approach significantly reduces the number of connectivity-phenotype comparisons needed to run a CWAS (Shehzad et al., in prep).</p>

<div class="section" id="computation-and-analysis-considerations">
<h2>Computation and Analysis Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#computation-and-analysis-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Computation steps for CWAS are listed below as described by Shehzad and colleagues (2012). For more detailed information about how C-PAC makes these calculations, please see the CWAS section of the developer documentation.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>For each subject, C-PAC computes the correlation of BOLD signals between every possible pair of gray matter voxels, resulting in a V x V correlation matrix for each subject (where V is the number of gray matter voxels).</li>
<li>To determine individual differences, patterns of whole-brain connectivity for each voxel are compared to the connectivity pattern for the same voxel between all possible pairs of subjects. A distance matrix is then computed which represents the dissimilarity between whole-brain connectivity patterns for any pair of subjects.</li>
<li>MDMR is then used to test whether, for each voxel, whole-brain connectivity patterns tend to be more similar for individuals with like phenotypes (within-group) than individuals with unlike phenotypes (between-group). This quantifies how well phenotypic variables explain the distances between participants in the distance matrix.</li>
<li>The significance of these similarities and differences is assessed with a permutation test. This identifies brain regions whose whole-brain pattern of connectivity is significantly predicted by a particular phenotypic variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The figure below (taken from Shehzad et al., 2010) outlines these steps. For more detail on how C-PAC handles these computations, please see the <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.com/docs/developer/workflows/cwas.html">CWAS section of the developer documentation</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>It is important to note that the results of MDMR analysis do not contain information about the direction of connectivity-phenotype relationships, nor the specific connections underlying these connectome-wide associations. Follow-up analysis using seed-based correlation analysis (or similar methods) is required to discover this information (Shehzad et al., in prep). To avoid bias caused by &#8216;double-dipping&#8217; your data (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009), this analysis should always be performed on an independent sample (Shehzad et al., in prep). Further, the results of these follow-up analyses should take into account existing knowledge about brain anatomy and physiology before being considered definitive (Shehzad et al., in prep).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="applications-and-recommendations">
<h2>Applications and Recommendations<a class="headerlink" href="#applications-and-recommendations" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>As C-PAC is one of the first public software packages to implement CWAS, it has yet to be utilized by more than a few researchers. The most notable use to date is the analysis performed by Shehzad and colleagues, who found robust associations between functional connectivity and a number of phenotypic characteristics including age, ADHD diagnosis, IQ, and <em>L-dopa</em> administration.</p>

</div>
<p>As CWAS examines connectivity across the whole brain, it may have reduced sensitivity to highly-localized sets of connections related to a phenotype. This issue can be addressed by limiting analysis to connectivity between specific anatomical regions (Shehzad et al., in prep), which can be accomplished by defining an ROI mask during C-PAC setup.</p>
