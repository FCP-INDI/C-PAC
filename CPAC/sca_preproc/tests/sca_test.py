Detailed_Description
____________________

	* Verify Correlations ::

		On Real Data -

		* Extract mean TimeSeries using the ROI from rest_res_filt nifti image
		* Compute the map of Voxel wise correlations using nibabel and numpy
		* Compare the correlations calculated manually against the ones in the input Correlations image(correlations nifti image)
		* Since Comparison is between floating points keep a + -  epsilon slack in comparison; epsilon ~= 0.005
		* Verify all values are between 0 & 1
		* If both these test evaluate to True then return True else Return False

		On Simulation Data -

		* Not sure
	
	
	* Verify Image Normalization ::
	
		On Real Data -
		
		* Use the voxel wise Correlation map from Correlations test to manually compute fisher-Z normalization scores
		* Compare the calculated correlation map values against the values from Z normalized input image
		* Check if the variance in the z scores is approx constant and that the correlation among values calculated in the prev two steps is epsilon closer to one 

	

		On Simulation Data -

		* Not sure
	
	* Verify Image Registration ::
	
		On Real Data -
	
		* Compute the spatial correlation of the registered Image(z_2standard) with the reference nifti image (ref)
		* Compute percentage overlap between registered image and the reference image and
		  between the input image(z_trans_correlations) and the reference image
		* The correlation values obtained when registered image is used should be higher than the when the input image is used (Need to test).
		* If the spatial correlation and percentage overlaps are above their respective thresholds then return True else False
		  (TODO: Decide before hand on the values of thresholds, a way to do that could be an average of correlation values of subjects on a big dataset)


		On Simulation Data -

		* Not sure
	
	
	* Verify Guassian Kernel Smoothing ::
	
		On Real Data -

		* Verify that the intensiy distribution in smoothed image is still centered at zero and have unit variance
		* Load the z_2standard input image in python. Form the (2-D ) Guassian kernel matrix( TODO: determine the size of the gaussian matrix)
		* Perform convolution of the loaded input image and the gaussian matrix to get the guassian smoothed image
		* Perform mean filtering (substitute the intensity of the voxel with the average intesity of the neighbouring voxels)
		* Compare the image yeilded from the previous step with the smoothed image input image(z_2standard_FWHM)
		* if the values are +- epsilon away then return True else return False

		On Simulation Data -

		* Not sure
