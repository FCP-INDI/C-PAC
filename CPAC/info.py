Troubleshooting and Help
------------------------

This is a beta version of CPAC, which means that it is still under active development. As such, although we have done our best to ensure a stable pipeline, 
there will likely still be a few bugs that we did not catch. If you find a bug, have a question that is not answered in the User Guide, or would like to suggest a new feature, 
please create an issue on CPAC github issue page: https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues?state=open
