    # Select Off if you intend to run CPAC on a single machine.
    # If set to On, CPAC will attempt to submit jobs through the job scheduler / resource manager selected below.

    # The maximum amount of memory each participant's workflow can allocate.
    # Use this to place an upper bound of memory usage.
    # - Warning: 'Memory Per Participant' multiplied by 'Number of Participants to Run Simultaneously'
    #   must not be more than the total amount of RAM.
    # - Conversely, using too little RAM can impede the speed of a pipeline run.
    # - It is recommended that you set this to a value that when multiplied by
    #   'Number of Participants to Run Simultaneously' is as much RAM you can safely allocate.
