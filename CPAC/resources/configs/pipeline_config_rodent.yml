    #   must not be more than the total amount of RAM.
    # - Conversely, using too little RAM can impede the speed of a pipeline run.

    #   'Number of Participants to Run Simultaneously' is as much RAM you can safely allocate.

    #   If you wish to dedicate multiple cores to ANTS-based anatomical registration (below),
    #   this value must be equal or higher than the amount of cores provided to ANTS.
    # - The maximum number of cores your run can possibly employ will be this setting multiplied

    #   Simultaneously' setting).
