    #   If you wish to dedicate multiple cores to ANTS-based anatomical registration (below),
    #   this value must be equal or higher than the amount of cores provided to ANTS.
    # - The maximum number of cores your run can possibly employ will be this setting multiplied

    #   Simultaneously' setting).
