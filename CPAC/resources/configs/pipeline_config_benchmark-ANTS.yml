    # Use this to place an upper bound of memory usage.
    # - Warning: 'Memory Per Participant' multiplied by 'Number of Participants to Run Simultaneously'
    #   must not be more than the total amount of RAM.
    # - Conversely, using too little RAM can impede the speed of a pipeline run.
    # - It is recommended that you set this to a value that when multiplied by
    #   'Number of Participants to Run Simultaneously' is as much RAM you can safely allocate.
    maximum_memory_per_participant: 3

    # The maximum amount of cores (on a single machine) or slots on a node (on a cluster/grid)

    # - Setting this above 1 will parallelize each participant's workflow where possible.
    #   If you wish to dedicate multiple cores to ANTS-based anatomical registration (below),
    #   this value must be equal or higher than the amount of cores provided to ANTS.
    # - The maximum number of cores your run can possibly employ will be this setting multiplied
    #   by the number of participants set to run in parallel (the 'Number of Participants to Run
    #   Simultaneously' setting).
