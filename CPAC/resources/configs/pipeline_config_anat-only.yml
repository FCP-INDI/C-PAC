    # If set to On, CPAC will attempt to submit jobs through the job scheduler / resource manager selected below.

    # Use this to place an upper bound of memory usage.
    # - Warning: 'Memory Per Participant' multiplied by 'Number of Participants to Run Simultaneously'
    #   must not be more than the total amount of RAM.
    # - Conversely, using too little RAM can impede the speed of a pipeline run.
    # - It is recommended that you set this to a value that when multiplied by
    #   'Number of Participants to Run Simultaneously' is as much RAM you can safely allocate.

    # Deletes the contents of the Working Directory after running.

    #   PhaseDiff - Perform field map correction using a single phase difference image, a subtraction of the two phase images from each echo. Default scanner for this method is SIEMENS.
    #   Blip - Uses AFNI 3dQWarp to calculate the distortion unwarp for EPI field maps of opposite/same phase encoding direction.
