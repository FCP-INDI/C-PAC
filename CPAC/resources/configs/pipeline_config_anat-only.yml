  output_directory: 

    # Directory where C-PAC should write out processed data, logs, and crash reports.
    # - If running in a container (Singularity/Docker), you can simply set this to an arbitrary
    #   name like '/output', and then map (-B/-v) your desired output directory to that label.
    # - If running outside a container, this should be a full path to a directory.

  working_directory: 

    # Directory where C-PAC should store temporary and intermediate files.
    # - This directory must be saved if you wish to re-run your pipeline from where you left off (if not completed).
    # - NOTE: As it stores all intermediate files, this directory can grow to become very
    #   large, especially for data with a large amount of TRs.
    # - If running in a container (Singularity/Docker), you can simply set this to an arbitrary
    #   name like '/work', and then map (-B/-v) your desired output directory to that label.
    # - If running outside a container, this should be a full path to a directory.
    # - This can be written to '/tmp' if you do not intend to save your working directory.

    # The maximum amount of memory each participant's workflow can allocate.
    # Use this to place an upper bound of memory usage.
    # - Warning: 'Memory Per Participant' multiplied by 'Number of Participants to Run Simultaneously'
    #   must not be more than the total amount of RAM.
    # - Conversely, using too little RAM can impede the speed of a pipeline run.
    # - It is recommended that you set this to a value that when multiplied by
    #   'Number of Participants to Run Simultaneously' is as much RAM you can safely allocate.
