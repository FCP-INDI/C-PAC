# General Group-Level Analysis Settings

pipeline_setup:

  # Name for this pipeline configuration - useful for identification.
  pipeline_name: cpac-group-template

  output_directory:

    # The main input of group-level analysis- the output directory of your individual-level analysis pipeline run (pre-processing & derivatives for each participant). This should be a path to your C-PAC individual-level run's pipeline folder, which includes the sub-directories labeled with the participant IDs.
    source_outputs_path : /source_output

    # (Optional) Full path to a list of participants to be included in the model. You can use this to easily prune participants from your model. In group-level analyses involving phenotype files, this allows you to prune participants without removing them from the phenotype CSV/TSV file. This should be a text file with one subject per line. An easy way to manually create this file is to copy the participant ID column from your phenotype file.
    participant_list: None

    # Full path to the directory where CPAC should place group-level analysis outputs and any applicable statistical model files.
    output_path: /output

  working_directory:

    #Much like the working directory for individual-level analysis, this is where the intermediate and working files will be stored during your run. This directory can be deleted later on. However, saving this directory allows the group analysis run to skip steps that have been already completed, in the case of re-runs.
    path: /tmp

    #Deletes the contents of the Working Directory after running.
    # This saves disk space, but any additional preprocessing or analysis will have to be completely re-run.
    remove_working_dir: True

  log_directory:
    
    # Whether to write log details of the pipeline run to the logging files.
    run_logging: True

    #Where to write out log information for your group analysis run.
    path: /logs

  crash_log_directory:

    # Directory where CPAC should write crash logs.
    path: /crash

  system_config:

    # The path to your FSL installation directory. This can be left as 'FSLDIR' to grab your system's default FSL installation. However, if you prefer to use a specific install of FSL, you can enter the path here.
    FSLDIR: FSLDIR

    # Number of CPUs to dedicate to the group-level analysis run. Parallelizes the pipeline where applicable.
    num_cpus: 1

    # The maximum amount of memory each participant's workflow can allocate.
    # Use this to place an upper bound of memory usage.
    # - Warning: 'Memory Per Participant' multiplied by 'Number of Participants to Run Simultaneously'
    #   must not be more than the total amount of RAM.
    # - Conversely, using too little RAM can impede the speed of a pipeline run.
    # - It is recommended that you set this to a value that when multiplied by
    #   'Number of Participants to Run Simultaneously' is as much RAM you can safely allocate.
    num_memory: 10

    # Scan inclusion list. For most group-level analyses, a separate model is run for each scan/series in your individual-level analysis pipeline directory.
    # Use this list to prune your run to only specific scans.
    # Example:
    # scan_inclusion: ['rest_run-1', 'rest_run-2']
    scan_inclusion: []

  Amazon-AWS:

    # If setting the 'Output Directory' to an S3 bucket, insert the path to your AWS credentials file here.

  ev_selections: {'demean': [], 'categorical': []}

  # Specify the formula to describe your model design. Essentially, including EVs in this formula inserts them into the model. The most basic format to include each EV you select would be 'EV + EV + EV + ..', etc. You can also select to include MeanFD, Measure_Mean, and Custom_ROI_Mean here. See the C-PAC User Guide for more detailed information regarding formatting your design formula.

  # Full path to a NIFTI file containing one or more ROI masks. The means of the masked regions will then be computed for each subject's output and will be included in the model as regressors (one for each ROI in the mask file) if you include 'Custom_ROI_Mean' in the Design Matrix Formula.

  # Specify your contrasts here. For example, if two of your available contrasts are EV1 and EV0, you can enter contrast descriptions such as 'EV1 - EV0 = 0' or 'EV1 = 0'. Consult the User Guide for more information about describing contrasts. Alternatively, you can provide your own custom-written contrasts matrix in a CSV file in the 'Custom Contrasts Matrix' field below.

  # If you wish to use the standard contrast builder, leave this field blank. If you provide a path for this option, CPAC will use your custom contrasts matrix instead, and will use the f-tests described in this custom file only (ignoring those you have input in the f-tests field above).
  # If you wish to include f-tests, create a new column in your CSV file for each f-test named 'f_test_1', 'f_test_2', .. etc. Then, mark the contrasts you would like to include in each f-test with a 1, and mark the rest 0. Note that you must select at least two contrasts per f-test.
