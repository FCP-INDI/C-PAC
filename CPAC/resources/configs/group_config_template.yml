# General Group-Level Analysis Settings
##############################################################################

# The main input of group-level analysis- the output directory of your individual-level analysis pipeline run (pre-processing & derivatives for each participant). This should be a path to your C-PAC individual-level run's pipeline folder, which includes the sub-directories labeled with the participant IDs.
pipeline_dir: /path/to/output_dir


# (Optional) Full path to a list of participants to be included in the model. You can use this to easily prune participants from your model. In group-level analyses involving phenotype files, this allows you to prune participants without removing them from the phenotype CSV/TSV file. This should be a text file with one subject per line. An easy way to manually create this file is to copy the participant ID column from your phenotype file.
participant_list: None


# Full path to the directory where CPAC should place group-level analysis outputs and any applicable statistical model files.
output_dir: /path/to/output/dir


#Much like the working directory for individual-level analysis, this is where the intermediate and working files will be stored during your run. This directory can be deleted later on. However, saving this directory allows the group analysis run to skip steps that have been already completed, in the case of re-runs.
work_dir: /path/to/work/dir


#Where to write out log information for your group analysis run.
log_dir: /path/to/log/dir


# The path to your FSL installation directory. This can be left as 'FSLDIR' to grab your system's default FSL installation. However, if you prefer to use a specific install of FSL, you can enter the path here.
FSLDIR: FSLDIR


# Number of CPUs to dedicate to the group-level analysis run. Parallelizes the pipeline where applicable.
num_cpus: 1


# Scan inclusion list. For most group-level analyses, a separate model is run for each scan/series in your individual-level analysis pipeline directory.
# Use this list to prune your run to only specific scans.
# Example:
#   scan_inclusion: ['rest_run-1', 'rest_run-2']
scan_inclusion: []


# FSL-FEAT

# Phenotype file
# Full path to a .csv or .tsv file containing EV/regressor information for each subject.
pheno_file: /path/to/phenotypic/file.csv


# Name of the participants column in your phenotype file.

ev_selections: {'demean': [], 'categorical': []}


# Specify the formula to describe your model design. Essentially, including EVs in this formula inserts them into the model. The most basic format to include each EV you select would be 'EV + EV + EV + ..', etc. You can also select to include MeanFD, Measure_Mean, and Custom_ROI_Mean here. See the C-PAC User Guide for more detailed information regarding formatting your design formula.
# design_formula: Sex + Diagnosis + Age + MeanFD_Jenkinson + Custom_ROI_Mean
design_formula:


# Choose the derivatives to run the group model on.
#
# These must be written out as a list, and must be one of the options listed below.
#
# For z-scored analyses:
# 'alff_to_standard_zstd', 'alff_to_standard_smooth_zstd', 'falff_to_standard_zstd', 'falff_to_standard_smooth_zstd', 'reho_to_standard_zstd', 'reho_to_standard_smooth_zstd', 'sca_roi_files_to_standard_fisher_zstd', 'sca_roi_files_to_standard_smooth_fisher_zstd', 'vmhc_fisher_zstd_zstat_map', 'dr_tempreg_maps_zstat_files_to_standard', 'dr_tempreg_maps_zstat_files_to_standard_smooth', 'sca_tempreg_maps_zstat_files', 'sca_tempreg_maps_zstat_files_smooth', 'centrality_outputs_zstd', 'centrality_outputs_smoothed_zstd'

# Choose whether to use a group mask or individual-specific mask when calculating the output means to be used as a regressor.
#
# This only takes effect if you include the 'Measure_Mean' regressor in your Design Matrix Formula.
mean_mask: ['Group Mask']


# Full path to a NIFTI file containing one or more ROI masks. The means of the masked regions will then be computed for each subject's output and will be included in the model as regressors (one for each ROI in the mask file) if you include 'Custom_ROI_Mean' in the Design Matrix Formula.
# custom_roi_mask: /path/to/mask.nii.gz
custom_roi_mask: None


# Choose the coding scheme to use when generating your model. 'Treatment' encoding is generally considered the typical scheme. Consult the User Guide for more information.
#
# Available options:
# 'Treatment', 'Sum'
#
coding_scheme: ['Treatment']


# Specify whether FSL should model the variance for each group separately.
#
# If this option is enabled, you must specify a grouping variable below.
group_sep: Off


# The name of the EV that should be used to group subjects when modeling variances.
#
# If you do not wish to model group variances separately, set this value to None.

z_threshold: ['2.3']


# Significance threshold (P-value) to use when doing cluster correction for multiple comparisons.
p_threshold: ['0.05']


# For repeated measures only. Enter the session names in your dataset that you wish to include within the same model (this is for repeated measures / within-subject designs).\n\nTip: These will be the names listed as "unique_id" in the original individual-level participant list, or the labels in the original data directories you marked as {session} while creating the CPAC participant list.
# sessions_list: ['ses-01', 'ses-02']
sessions_list: []


# For repeated measures only. Enter the series names in your dataset that you wish to include within the same model (this is for repeated measures / within-subject designs).\n\nTip: These will be the labels listed under "func:" in the original individual-level participant list, or the labels in the original data directories you marked as {series} while creating the CPAC participant list.
# series_list: ['task-rest_run-1', 'task-rest_run-2']
series_list: []


# Specify your contrasts here. For example, if two of your available contrasts are EV1 and EV0, you can enter contrast descriptions such as 'EV1 - EV0 = 0' or 'EV1 = 0'. Consult the User Guide for more information about describing contrasts. Alternatively, you can provide your own custom-written contrasts matrix in a CSV file in the 'Custom Contrasts Matrix' field below.
# contrasts: ['C(Diagnosis)[T.ADHD] - C(Diagnosis)[T.Typical] = 0', 'C(Diagnosis)[T.Typical] - C(Diagnosis)[T.ADHD] = 0']
contrasts: []


# Optional: A list of f-test strings containing contrasts. If you do not wish to run f-tests, leave this blank.
f_tests: []


# Optional: Full path to a CSV file which specifies the contrasts you wish to run in group analysis. Consult the User Guide for proper formatting.
# If you wish to use the standard contrast builder, leave this field blank. If you provide a path for this option, CPAC will use your custom contrasts matrix instead, and will use the f-tests described in this custom file only (ignoring those you have input in the f-tests field above).
# If you wish to include f-tests, create a new column in your CSV file for each f-test named 'f_test_1', 'f_test_2', .. etc. Then, mark the contrasts you would like to include in each f-test with a 1, and mark the rest 0. Note that you must select at least two contrasts per f-test.
