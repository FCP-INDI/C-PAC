# Use this file to generate the data configuration (participant list) YAML file by loading it via the 'Load Preset' button in the Data Configuration Builder UI, or via command line by providing it to the cpac_data_config_setup.py script with the --data_settings_file input flag.


# Select if data is organized using BIDS standard or a custom format.
# Options: 'BIDS' or 'Custom'
dataFormat: BIDS


# Base directory of BIDS-organized data.
# BIDS Data Format only.
#
# This should be the path to the overarching directory containing the entire dataset.
bidsBaseDir: None


# File Path Template for Anatomical Files
# Custom Data Format only.
# 
# Place tags for the appropriate data directory levels with the tags {site}, {participant}, and {session}. Only {participant} is required.
# 
# Examples:
# /data/{site}/{participant}/{session}/anat/mprage.nii.gz
# /data/{site}/{participant}/anat.nii.gz
# 
# See the User Guide for more detailed instructions.
anatomicalTemplate: None


# File Path Template for Functional Files
# Custom Data Format only.
# 
# Place tags for the appropriate data directory levels with the tags {site}, {participant}, {session}, and {series}. Only {participant} is required.
# 
# Examples:
# /data/{site}/{participant}/{session}/func/{series}_bold.nii.gz
# /data/{site}/{participant}/{series}/func.nii.gz
# 
# See the User Guide for more detailed instructions.

# Scan/Run ID for the Anatomical Scan
#
# Sometimes, there are multiple anatomical scans for each participant in a dataset.
#
# If this is the case, you can choose which anatomical scan to use for this participant by entering the identifier that makes the scan unique.
#
# Examples:
#
# BIDS dataset
# ../anat/sub-001_run-1_T1w.nii.gz
# ../anat/sub-001_run-2_T1w.nii.gz
# Pick the second with 'run-2'.
#
# Custom dataset
# Example use case: let's say most anatomicals in your dataset are '../mprage.nii.gz', but some participants only have '../anat1.nii.gz' and '../anat2.nii.gz'. You want the mprage.nii.gz files included, but only the anat2.nii.gz in the others.
#
# Place a wildcard (*) in the anatomical filepath template above (../*.nii.gz), then enter 'anat2' in this field to 'break the tie' for participants that have the 'anat1' and 'anat2' scans.
anatomical_scan: None


# For Slice Timing Correction.
# Custom Data Format only.
#
# Path to a .csv file (if not using BIDS-format JSON files) containing information about scan acquisition parameters.
#
# For instructions on how to create this file, see the User Guide.
#
# If 'None' is specified, CPAC will look for scan parameters information provided in the pipeline configuration file.
scanParametersCSV: None


# File Path Template for brain mask files.
# For anatomical skull-stripping.
# Both BIDS and Custom Data Formats.
# (Note: The BIDS specification is still in flux regarding anatomical derivatives - if using a BIDS data directory, use this field to specify the format of your anatomical brain mask file paths.)
#
# Place tags for the appropriate data directory levels with the tags {site}, {participant}, and {session}.
#
# Examples:
# /data/{site}/{participant}/{session}/{participant}_{session}_brain-mask.nii.gz
brain_mask_template: None


# File Path Template for Field Map Phase files
# For field-map based distortion correction.
# Custom Data Format only.
#
# Place tags for the appropriate data directory levels with the tags {site}, {participant}, and {session}.
#
# Examples:
# /data/{site}/{participant}/{session}/fmap/phase.nii.gz
# /data/{site}/{participant}/{session}/{participant}_{session}_phase.nii.gz
fieldMapPhase: None


# File Path Template for Field Map Magnitude files
# For field-map based distortion correction.
# Custom Data Format only.
