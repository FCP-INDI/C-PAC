    #   PhaseDiff - Perform field map correction using a single phase difference image, a subtraction of the two phase images from each echo. Default scanner for this method is SIEMENS.
    #   Blip - Uses AFNI 3dQWarp to calculate the distortion unwarp for EPI field maps of opposite/same phase encoding direction.
    #   NOTE:
    #     this is NOT a fork point - instead, the technique used will depend on what type of distortion correction field data accompanies the dataset
    #     for example, phase-difference field maps will lead to phase-difference distortion correction, and phase-encoding direction field maps will lead to blip-up/blip-down
    using: [None]

      # Set the fraction value for the skull-stripping of the magnitude file. Depending on the data, a tighter extraction may be necessary in order to prevent noisy voxels from interfering with preparing the field map.
