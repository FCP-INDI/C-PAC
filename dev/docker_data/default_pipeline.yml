  output_directory:

    # Directory where C-PAC should write out processed data, logs, and crash reports.
    # - If running in a container (Singularity/Docker), you can simply set this to an arbitrary
    #   name like '/output', and then map (-B/-v) your desired output directory to that label.
    # - If running outside a container, this should be a full path to a directory.
    path: /output

    # (Optional) Path to a BIDS-Derivatives directory that already has outputs.
    #   - This option is intended to ingress already-existing resources from an output
    #     directory without writing new outputs back into the same directory.
    #   - If provided, C-PAC will ingress the already-computed outputs from this directory and
    #     continue the pipeline from where they leave off.
    #   - If left as 'None', C-PAC will ingress any already-computed outputs from the
    #     output directory you provide above in 'path' instead, the default behavior.
    source_outputs_dir: None

    # Set to True to make C-PAC ingress the outputs from the primary output directory if they
    # exist, even if a source_outputs_dir is provided
    #   - Setting to False will pull from source_outputs_dir every time, over-writing any
    #     calculated outputs in the main output directory
    #   - C-PAC will still pull from source_outputs_dir if the main output directory is
    #     empty, however
    pull_source_once: True

  working_directory:

    # Directory where C-PAC should store temporary and intermediate files.
    # - This directory must be saved if you wish to re-run your pipeline from where you left off (if not completed).
    # - NOTE: As it stores all intermediate files, this directory can grow to become very
    #   large, especially for data with a large amount of TRs.
    # - If running in a container (Singularity/Docker), you can simply set this to an arbitrary
    #   name like '/work', and then map (-B/-v) your desired output directory to that label.
    # - If running outside a container, this should be a full path to a directory.
    # - This can be written to '/tmp' if you do not intend to save your working directory.
