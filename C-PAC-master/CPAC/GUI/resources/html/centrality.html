<h2>Introduction &amp; Background<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-background" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Nodes are the basic units of a network. Among the many nodes that form the whole-brain network (the functional connectome), some play a crucial role and are considered &#8220;central&#8221; within the network. These central nodes can be identified by applying various graph-theory based network analysis techniques which provide a measure of the &#8220;centrality&#8221; or functional importance of each node (Koschutzki et al. 2005). Different centrality measures capture different aspects of connectivity (Joyce et al., 2010; Zuo et al., 2011), as discussed below. C-PAC treats each voxel as a node and calculates two commonly used centrality indices: Degree Centrality (DC) and Eigenvector Centrality (EC). Unlike traditional functional connectivity analyses, centrality measures capture the complexity of the entire functional connectome, and do not require the selection of any <em>a priori</em> regions of interest.</p>
<p>Degree centrality is a measure of local network connectivity and identifies the most connected nodes by counting the number of direct connections to all other nodes. As such, a node with high DC will have strong, direct connections to many other nodes in the network. Degree centrality analysis tends to emphasize higher order cortical association areas while showing reduced sensitivity for paralimbic and subcortical regions (Zuo et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Eigenvector centrality is a measure of global network connectivity. The EC of a given node reflects the number of direct connections it has with nodes that have high centrality. Thus, the EC of a given node depends not only on its own centrality, but the centrality of the nodes it connects to. A node with high EC has strong connections to many other nodes that are themselves highly connected and central within the network. In contrast to DC, EC is more sensitive to paralimbic and subcortical regions (Zuo et al., 2012).</p>
<p>The figure below (taken from Zuo et al., 2012) shows differences in centrality across the brain, as well as differences between EC and DC measures.</p>

<h2>Computation and Analysis Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#computation-and-analysis-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>For each subject, the timeseries for each voxel is extracted and used to calculate a temporal correlation matrix which represents the connectivity between all voxels. A threshold is then applied to the correlation matrix to create an adjacency matrix which describes all nodes that have survived thresholding. In C-PAC, users can choose to apply a threshold based on either sparsity, significance, or correlation strength. Threshold values should be chosen carefully, as they can strongly influence the results of centrality analysis (Zuo et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Of the two centrality measures computed by C-PAC, Degree Centrality is the simplest, and is computed by counting the number of significant correlations between the timeseries of a given voxel and all other voxels in the adjacency matrix. Eigenvector Centrality is computed by identifying the first eigenvector of the adjacency matrix, which corresponds to the largest eigenvalue. Since EC is a recursive measure that takes into account the properties of connected nodes, the EC of a given voxel is proportional to the sum of the EC of all directly neighboring voxels. After computing the centrality measures, voxel-based graphs are generated and standardized using Z-scores for use in group analysis (Zuo et al., 2012). For more detail on how C-PAC computes these steps, please see the <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.com/docs/developer/workflows/network_centrality.html">Network Centrality section of the developer documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Applications and Recommendations<a class="headerlink" href="#applications-and-recommendations" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Degree centrality has been widely used to identify &#8220;functional hubs&#8221; and examine node characteristics of intrinsic connectivity networks (Buckner et al. 2009; Bullmore and Sporns 2009; He et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2010; Fransson et al. 2011). Centrality measures have also been used to show that the topology of these hub structures changes with age. Specifically, cortical hubs are largely confined to primary sensory and motor areas in infants (Fransson et al. 2011), but are localized to heteromodal higher-order association regions in adults (Buckner et al. 2009).</p>

<p>Beyond detecting functional hubs, both DC and EC have been used as a way of characterizing information flow through the functional connectome at the voxel level. These voxel-wise centrality analyses (depicted in the figure above, taken from Zuo et al., 2012) showed both short and long-term test-retest reliability, and appear to be modulated by age and sex (Zuo et al., 2012). Additionally, EC has been shown to be modulated by subjects&#8217; states of hunger or satiety (Lohmann et al. 2010).</p>
