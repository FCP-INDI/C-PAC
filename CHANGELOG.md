## [unreleased]

### Added
- Added the ability to downsample to 10K or 2K resolution for freesurfer runs
- Added the ability to run AFNI 3dDespike on template-space BOLD data.
- Added the ability to ingress TotalReadoutTime from epi field map meta-data from the JSON sidecars.
- Added the ability to use TotalReadoutTime of epi field maps in the calculation of FSL topup distortion correction.
- Difference method (``-``) for ``CPAC.utils.configuration.Configuration`` instances
- Calculate reho and alff when timeseries in template space
- Added new default pipeline that uses FSL-BET for brain extraction. Previous default pipleine is now called default-deprecated.
- Added ``fail_fast`` configuration setting and CLI flag

### Changed
- Space labels in output filenames now contain specific template labels for MNI templates
- Added a level of depth to `working` directories to match `log` and `output` directory structure
- Renamed participant-pipeline-level `output` directory prefix to `pipeline_` to match `log` and `working` paths
- Changed the 1mm atlases chosen in the rbc-options preconfig to the 2mm versions
- For Nilearn-generated correlation matrices, diagonals are now set to all `1`s (were all `0`s)
- Added ability to apply nusiance correction to template-space BOLD images
- Removed ability to run single-step-resampling on motion-corrected BOLD data
- Moved default pipeline config into directory with other preconfigs
- Added crash messages from during and before graph building to logs
- Added data-config-specific hash string to C-PAC-generated config files
- Updated `rbc-options` preconfig to use `fmriprep-options` preprocessing
- Changed minimized pipeline base from `default` to `blank`
- Removed deprecated `--disable_file_logging` CLI flag
- Improved flexibility of some pipeline options regarding the application of distortion correction transforms
- Pinned AFNI to AFNI_21.1.00

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the distortion correction un-warps were not being applied to the final template-space BOLD time series data depending on pipeline configuration decisions.
- Fixed [a bug](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1779) in which generated pipeline configs were not 100% accurate. The only affected configurable option discovered in testing was seed-based correlation analysis always reverting to the default configuration.
- Fixed [bug](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1795) that was causing `cpac run` to fail when passing a manual random seed via `--random_seed`.
- Replaces ``DwellTime`` with ``EffectiveEchoSpacing`` for FSL usage of the term
- Fixed an issue that was causing some epi field maps to not be ingressed if the BIDS tags were not in the correct order.
- Fixed an issue where some phase-difference GRE field map files were not properly being ingressed if the filenames were not expected.
- Fixed a bug where ALFF & f/ALFF would not run if frequency filtering was disabled earlier in the pipeline.

- Added `--runtime_usage` and `--runtime_buffer` flags and related pipeline config entries and functionality
- Added additional error checks and a more informative message for node block connecting in the engine
- Expanded some surface post-processing workflows to be more flexible with other pipeline configurations
- Added [lint definition file](./.pylintrc) (for developers)
- Added list of preconfigured pipelines to the usage string
- Added CI smoke tests for preconfigs

### Changed
- Made ndmg correlation matrices a configurable option

- Relicensed C-PAC from BSD-3-Clause to LGPL-3.0-or-later

### Fixed
- Fixed [bug](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1741) that was causing `single_step_resampling` to inadvertently cause unexpected forks in the pipeline past transform application.
- Fixed [bug](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1702) that was causing `single_step_resampling` to crash with `3dVolReg`
- Fixed [bug](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1686) that was causing datasets containing phase-difference field maps to crash.
- Fixed merge error preventing QC files and surface derivatives copying to output directory and renaming connectome â†’ connectivity matrix files
- Fixed some incorrect connections in XCP-QC file generation
- Fixed a bug where subsequent subjects' logs were being appended to prior subjects' logs
- Fixed templates used for rodent pipeline and added outputs that were missing
- Fixed [bug](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1556) in which ITK header imprecision was causing N4 bias correction to crash
- Fixed a bug where a node with zero nanoseconds in timing information causes report generation to fail.
- Fixed a bug in which `--tracking_opt-out` was not applied to calls to `utils`

## [1.8.3] - 2022-02-11

### Added
- Added XCP-style quality control file
- Added RBC-options pipeline preconfiguration
- Added `engine.log` (when verbose debugging is on)

    - `antsAI`

### Changed
- In a given pipeline configuration, segmentation probability maps and binary tissue masks are warped to template space, and those warped masks are included in the output directory
    - if `registration_workflows['functional_registration']['EPI_registration']['run segmentation']` is `On` and `segmentation['tissue_segmentation']['Template_Based']['template_for_segmentation']` includes `EPI_Template`
    
      and/or

- Fixed broken links in README
- Fixed [bug](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1575) in which anatomical-only configurations required functional data directories
- Fixed [bug](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1532) in which nuisance regressors would crash when segmentation is off and no CSF mask is provided
