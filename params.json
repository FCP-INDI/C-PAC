Download: `C-PAC/scripts/cpac_install.sh`\r\n2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x /path/to/cpac_install.sh`\r\n3. Run as super-user: `sudo ./path/to/cpac_install.sh`\r\n\r\nOtherwise, follow the installation documentation here: http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/install.html\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nUser documentation can be found here: http://fcp-indi.github.com/docs/user/index.html\r\n\r\nDeveloper documentation can be found here: http://fcp-indi.github.com/docs/developer/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion Forum\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIf you are stuck and need help or have any other questions or comments about C-PAC, there is a C-PAC discussion forum here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cpax_forum\r\n\r\nIssue Tracker and Bugs\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThis is an alpha version of C-PAC, which means that it is still under active development. As such, although we have done our best to ensure a stable pipeline, \r\nthere will likely still be a few bugs that we did not catch. If you find a bug or would like to suggest a new feature, \r\nplease open an issue on the the C-PAC Github issue tracker: https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues?state=open\r\n\r\nIf you would like to suggest revisions to the user documentation, please open an issue on the C-PAC website's Github issue tracker: https://github.com/FCP-INDI/fcp-indi.github.com/issues\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
