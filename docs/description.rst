Troubleshooting and Help
------------------------

This is a beta version of CPAC, which means that it is still under active
development. As such, although we have done our best to ensure a stable
pipeline, there will likely still be a few bugs that we did not catch. If you
find a bug, have a question that is not answered in the User Guide, or would
like to suggest a new feature, please create an issue on CPAC github issue
