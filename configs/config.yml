# Notes on setting up SGE for C-PAC
#
# SGE users must set up their parallel environment before running C-PAC.
# A pipeline for each subject that needs preprocessing should be spawned
# on single node of the cluster. To avoid I/O overhead, the pipeline should
# only use the resources (cores) from that node. Users can enable this feature
# on Sun Grid Engine by modifying their parallel environment.
#
# To create a new environment based on an existing one, follow these steps:
# 1. List existing parallel environments
#    $ qconf -spl
# 2. View the settings for an existing environment
#    $ qconf -sp environment_name
#    
#    Example output:
#    pe_name            mpi

#    control_slaves     TRUE
#    job_is_first_task  FALSE

#
# 3. Create a new environment based on an existing one
#    $ qconf -sp environment_name > environment_name_cpac
# 4. Edit the new environment and set allocation_rule to $pe_slots
# 5. Add the new environment file to SGE

# The following options specify the path of various resources used by C-PAC
# By default, C-PAC will automatically locate most files based on FSLDIR
# Most users will not need to modify these values

# For users wishing to use non-standard versions of these resources:
## 1) Delete the string in parentheses beginning with FSLDIR
## 2) Replace this value with the full path to the appropriate file
## 3) Repalce the resolution (e.g. 2mm) with %s in the file names.
##    This allows resources to be automatically selected based on the
##    standardResolution set above.
